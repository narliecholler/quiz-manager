# Quiz Manager Application

This application is meant to be a learning curve in building a TDD, full-stack application with a NoSQL database like MongoDB. The idea is that a quiz manager will allow users to login and have a session (jwt), with specific users only having certain authorization to endpoints and data. The user can then see all the quiz data and update questions / answers within a quiz (per the user authorization).

Tech Stack:
  - Frontend: React/Typescript (nextjs)
  - Backend: Express/Typescript
  - Database: MongoDB (+mongoose)

## Current Progress

[WIP] - Build out user functionality
